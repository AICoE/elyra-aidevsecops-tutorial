# MNIST Classification

The demo application selected for this tutorial is the `MNIST Classification`. The `MNIST Dataset` is described [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
We have created different versions for the MNIST application depending on different use cases (you can just pick one and go ahead with the tutorial).

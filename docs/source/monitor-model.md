# Monitor your model and application with Prometheus and Grafana

1. Open issue in [Operate First][1] [support](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues) and request Prometheus scraping the model endpoint `/metrics` for the application deployed in your namespace.

2. Create new Grafana dashbord for the metrics to see how the application and model are performing and open issue in [Operate First][1] [support](https://github.com/operate-first/support/issues) on how to have your dashboard deployed.
